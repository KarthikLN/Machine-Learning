Before Working on the data. we have to check few feature engineering Features.

Feature Engineering on Handling Missing Data.
Feature Engineering on Handling Imbalanced Dataset.
Feature Engineering on SMOTE.
Feature Engineering on handling outliers.
Feature Engineering on Data Encoding Techiniques(Nominal,Ordinal)

Then We will start working on EDA.

After Working on EDA, we will create a model for predicting the price of the house rent in specific areas which are mentioned.

Firstly, we would check the Rent in different cities based on City and Rent.
